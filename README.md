# Basic Launcher Native

the new/alternative version of my [basic-launcher](https://github.com/ingobeans/basic-launcher)

it uses pygame rather than eel! 

## why pygame?

i switched from eel because i wanted to be able to compile to binary that doesn't rely on a browser / electron. also eel was quite slow at launching

pygame is easy to build, and has **native controller support**, which is and was one of the primary goals of basic-launcher. most UI libraries don't offer controller support.
